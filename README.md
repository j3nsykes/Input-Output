# Input-Output
## An introductory 6 week class to exploring physical interactives

We will be working with [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/), [Max Msp](https://cycling74.com/) and [Processing](https://processing.org/) to explore various methods of creative coding. 

The main Arduino board we will be working with is the [Adafruit Itsy Bity](https://learn.adafruit.com/introducing-adafruit-itsybitsy-m4?view=all) which allows us to take advantage of the [Ardublockly](https://ardublockly.embeddedlog.com/demo/index.html) Blockly platform. 

## Over the 6 weeks we will look at 
- physical outputs such as light and motors
- sensors such as ultrasonic and IR sensors
- triggering sounds
- triggering video
- more complex motor outputs such as servo motors
- capacitive sensing (touch).
